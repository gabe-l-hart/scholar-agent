# Rubric

This Rubric is a guide to identifying the key parts of your daily workflow that are most appropriate to offload to AI agents

## 1. Write down everything you do in an average week

## 2. For each, rank by the following

- **enjoyment**: How much do you enjoy the process of doing the task
- **importance**: How critical is the task to your overall success
- **time commitment**: How much of your time does the task take
- **human-ness**: How important is it that _you_ personally are the one doing the task

## 3. Eliminate work that is:

- Too "human": This can't be done by an AI and retain the human touch
- Highly enjoyable: This is the work you want to keep doing yourself!
- Takes very little time: The time spent fixing the AI's mistakes will probably outweigh the time savings

## 4. Rank by importance
